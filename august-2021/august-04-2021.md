I thought of two things today:

* Effects from function application outside of a pure functional programming context can also be typed
* Types themselves can be used instead of values

Previously, I've considered subset types, and intersection between well defined types and nominal types, which looks like: `Real Positive ReturnedFrom(unitGaussian) OnInterval("(]", 0, 1)` which is a composition of those types through intersection. However, for functions that, for instance, takes a reference to a variable and change that variable internally, or for functions that make changes to global variables or changes in the filesystem, function types like `A B C ... foo(X x, Y y, ...)` can't describe these effects

To describe them you could have additional types attached to parameters, which really aren't types of the parameters but how the function will affect the parameters, and a type attached to the function for other effects on the system it can have

Something like: `File OpenFile logFileAndOpen(DataLog Container log > Modifies AddsTo, String AsciiString FileString fileName > NullEffect) > ModifiesGlobal(openFileCount) AccessesFilesystem {...}`. Where `OpenFile` is a nominal / tag type (and a subset of `File`), but the type-like things to the right of the `>` are effect types: `Modifies` means the function internally modifies / changes the state of `log`, intersecting this is another effect type `AddsTo` which is a (probably not very realistic) nominal / tag effect type representing that the function writes to `log` but doesn't remove anything; `ModifiesGlobal(var)`, which is a function effect, not a parameter effect, says that the function changes the state of a global variable `var`; and this is intersected with a nominal / tag effect type `AccessesFilesystem` which implies the function changes the state of the filesystem; and finally just to be obvious `NullEffect` as an effect type on `fileName` implies that the function does *not* have any effect on `fileName`, and could be used to force that the function doesn't have any effect on the parameter

Presumably, an analysis pass of a function's source (and maybe even on compiled functions) could automatically determine if a function `Modifies` parameters or `ModifiesGlobal(...)` global variables, and through system calls could determine if the function `AccessesFilesystem` or has any other interactions with the os

Along the lines of effect types, I have this idea, which seems elusive right now, that they could be used to mark the long range effects of the use of a particular function. Like, if a function `f` causes any variable set to its return to take on a particular value in some circumstance in the future. Similarly, if a function `f` takes some information and generates a behavior object which guides the actions of the system, then effect types might be useful for describing to the system when to use `f` in terms of long-range attribution of behaviors and real effects. Like, the effect type describes how the behavior of input information will change in the not-immediate future based on the use of `f`. This may (probably) be especially powerful when using effect types with internal semantics that are correlated with the system's experiences

Types, sets, semantic extensions (loosely), and patterns are all equivalent up to some point. Imagine this scenario: you are recording numbers from some device, and the numbers are jumping around slightly at some insignificant order of magnitude and you eventually just decide on a number to write down (probably one your brain encodes as more abstract and information-less than the others). The number you wrote down is actually representative of a set of numbers. This is also true, apparently, at tiny scales and to a fundamental degree, in real experiments: there is always a set of apparent values something can actually take

Taking this to the extreme: every value is actually just a very constrained set. So you could theoretically have a system *only ever* use types and never actual values. This would look like lots of what amounts to first and second order threading (though you would never actually calculate values) which would probably look like: `OnInterval(-1, 1) + OnInterval(-1, 1) == OnInterval(-2, 2)`;  and lots of effective increasing and decreasing set sizes through intersection, union, complements, etc operations

And of course values can also be interpreted as types containing a single value. eg: The value `1` is equivalent to `Real Integer MemberOf({1})` or something. In this case, applying a function to an assumed 'value' should automatically thread over it:

$f(\{x_i\}_i) = \{f(x_i)\}_i$

And second order threading over all parameters:

$f(\{x_{i\,j}\}_i)_j = \bigcup_j \{f(x_{i\,j})\}_i$
