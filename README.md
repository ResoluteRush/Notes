This is just a repo for:
* Notes
* Ideas
* Maybe other stuff
* etc

Generally about automated intelligence

Notes:
* I'm generally completely / partially incoherent
* Math heavy (unfortunately github's markdown renderer / viewer doesn't render math)
* I frequently write function composition like $f_n \circ f_{n-1} \circ \dots \circ f_1 (x) = f_n\, f_{n-1}\, \dots\, f_1\, x$ because I like it
